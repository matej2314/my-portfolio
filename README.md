## Idea of the project

After six months of learning JavaScript, I decided to start using React.js as a frontend framework. The first project I created with React is this Portfolio. It's my personal website where I showcase my projects, skills, and the courses Iâ€™ve completed.

## Functionality

This is a full-stack project, but every user visiting my site will first see the frontend application, which displays data and allows users to contact me. To make editing the data easier, I built a simple CMS. This intermediate app allows changes to every part of the data displayed on the main page. I also developed a basic API server that delivers all the data and handles communication with the database.
